# ai-agents-chat

this is my first code practise at all - done it in July 2025. you need api keys from two ai model routers or agents. i done it with hyperbolic and open router. create and activate venv after this download libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt) you need to choose models and inscribe it in logic.py and config.py. also you can work with proxy but it not required. if you want to, inscribe it in config and proxy_test.py. before every work you can test your proxy simply by doing proxy_text.py
